# Overview
As application developers, we understand that database connection pools are crucial for managing database connections efficiently. Connection pools help in reusing existing connections, reducing the overhead of creating new connections for each request, and managing the number of connections to avoid exhausting system resources. However, it is important to ensure that connection pools are managed properly to avoid issues such as connection leaks, resource exhaustion, and performance degradation.
# Background
This blog post is based on our experience with a legacy codebase that has extensive PL/SQL code to be invoked and uses a dedicated database connection per user.
# What is the Pool Size? Why is it Important? How to Determine the Optimal Pool Size?
The pool size refers to the maximum number of connections that can be created in the connection pool.
-**Importance:** The pool size determines the number of connections that can be used concurrently by the application. If the pool size is too small, the application may experience connection timeouts or performance degradation due to insufficient connections. Conversely, if the pool size is too large, it may lead to resource exhaustion and contention for system resources.
- **Determining Optimal Pool Size:** The optimal pool size can be determined based on factors such as the number of concurrent users, the workload of the application, and the capacity of the database server.
# Best Practices for Managing Connections
## Taking a Connection from the Pool:
- **Acquire Connection:** Acquiring a connection from the pool should be done in a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the process.
- **Set Connection Properties:** Setting connection properties such as auto-commit, isolation level, and read-only mode should be done based on the requirements of the application.
- **Handle Connection Timeouts:** Handling connection timeouts ensures that the application does not hang indefinitely waiting for a connection from the pool.
### Below Practices are Helpful if You Have Extensive PL/SQL Code to be Invoked:
- **Rollback Uncommitted Transactions:** Rolling back uncommitted transactions ensures that any changes made during a session that were not committed are undone. This helps maintain data integrity and ensures that the next user of the connection starts with a clean slate.
- **Reset the Session State:** Resetting the session state ensures that any session-specific settings, variables, or states are cleared. This prevents any leftover state from affecting subsequent users of the connection.
- **Truncate Temporary Tables:** Truncating temporary tables ensures that any temporary data from the previous session is removed. This helps in freeing up space and ensures that the next user of the connection does not see any residual data.
## Returning Connection to the Pool:
- **Commit Transactions:** Committing transactions ensures that any changes made during the session are saved to the database. This helps in maintaining data consistency and durability
